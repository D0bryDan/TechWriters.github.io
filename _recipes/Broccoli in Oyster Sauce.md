Broccoli with Oyster Sauce

Ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 head broccoli
- 1 table spoon soy sauce
- pinch of sugar
- 2 garlic gloves, smashed and peeled

1. In a small bowl, whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, cornstarch, sugar, and 1 tablespoon water.
2. In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium-high. Add garlic and broccoli. Cook, tossing occasionally, until broccoli is bright green, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water, cover, and cook until broccoli is tender but still has some bite, about 2 1/2 minutes. Add oyster sauce mixture; cook until thickened, about 1 minute.

Enjoy!
